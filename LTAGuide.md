The road to LTA approval is long and hard but stick it out and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

## Funding

This is your supervisor's responsibility and will be required in order to go to your LTA. This should be done well in advance and is best applied for for the year so you have funding to fall back on should you wish to extend your LTA. Then the next steps are visa steps.

## Affiliation

The first step to your LTA is to get the J-1 Visa in order to legally 'work' in the United States.

For this process to begin, you (or your supervisor) need to send an email to Simon Fiorucci (sfiorucci@lbl.gov) describing the potential dates and duration of your LTA and ask for you to become an LBNL affiliate. This will enable you to receive an invitation to work in the US. Once he contacts HR at LBNL, you'll receive a few emails about becoming an affiliate at the Lab. Tire through those and you'll become an affiliate!

Once that's gone through, HR will be in touch within a week or two, detailing the next steps and sending you a physical copy of your official invitation to the States. This is called the DS-2019 form and consists of two pages, the first with a few administrative details and the second with the terms and conditions of this invitation. **Make sure you check the program start and end date,** as your visa will be voided if you enter the states 30 days before or after that day. The only field that you should fill is on the bottom of the first page where you need to sign and date the form.
