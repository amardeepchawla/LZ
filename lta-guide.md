## LTA Guide

The road to LTA approval is long and hard but stick it out and eventually you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.

The first step to this is to try and get the J-1 Visa in order to legally 'work' in the United States.

For this process to begin, you (or your supervisor) need to send an email to Simon Fiorucci for you to become an LBNL affiliate. This will enable you to receive an invitation to work in the US. Once he contacts HR at LBNL, you'll receive a few emails about becoming an affiliate at the Lab. Tire through those and you'll become an affiliate.
